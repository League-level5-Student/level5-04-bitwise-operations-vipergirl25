		 * Step 1: Start with one and add a digit the left that is double the value of the previous number.
		 *         Stop when you've passed the target number        
		 *         eg. 43
		 *         	64	32	16	8	4	2	1
		 *        
		 *	Step 2: Remove the left most value (the one that is higher than the target). 
		 *			eg. 43
		 *         	32	16	8	4	2	1
		 *         
		 *  Step 3: Find the combination of values that add up to the target number.
		 *  		eg. 43
		 *         	32	16	8	4	2	1
		 *          43 = 32 + 8 + 2 + 1
		 *         
		 *  Step 4: Every matching number in the list is a 1, and non-matching is a 0.
		 *  		eg. 43
		 *         	32	16	8	4	2	1
		 *          43 = 32 + 8 + 2 + 1
		 *         
		 *          1    0   1   0   1   1
		 *          32	16	 8	 4	 2	 1
		 *         
		 *         43 in decimal is 101011 in binary!
